# How to Push Your Project to GitHub

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Enter a repository name (e.g., "interactive-animations")
3. Add a description (optional): "Interactive web animations with particle effects and fluid simulation"
4. Choose "Public" or "Private" visibility
5. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to connect your existing repository.
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and REPO_NAME with your repository name
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Take a Screenshot for the README
1. Open combined-animations.html in your browser
2. Interact with the animation to get a visually appealing state
3. Take a screenshot
4. Save it as "screenshot.png" in your project directory
5. Add and commit the screenshot:
   ```bash
   git add screenshot.png
   git commit -m "Add screenshot of animation"
   git push
   ```

## 4. Verify Your Repository
1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files and the README with your screenshot

Your project is now successfully hosted on GitHub!
